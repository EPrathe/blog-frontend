        I spent one year working as a full stack developer at Unisys, there I created software that allowed users 
        to apply for loans from the USDA.

        <p>
        Next I worked for two years as a front end devloper at Martiz Motivation. 
        At Maritz I worked on web based applications that gave companies
        the ability to create rewards programs.
